# Page-Editor
A chrome extension that allows you to edit ANY webpage as if it were a word doc. It's a really simple extension that simply toggles the ```document.designmode``` parameter on the currently active tab. It's a quick project I did to learn a little about building browser extensions. Check it out on the chrome web store here:
